### Categories of ML

1. Supervised Learning

   basic learning,  ex: tell computer "This is table"

   - Initially, researchers started out with Supervised Learning. This is the case of housing price prediction discussed earlier.

2. Unsupervised Learning, *clustering*

   - This was followed by unsupervised learning, where the **machine is made to learn on its own without any supervision**.

3. Reinforcement Learning

   - Scientists discovered further that it may be a good idea to reward the machine when it does the job the expected way and there came the Reinforcement Learning.

4. Deep Learning ,  *classification*

   baseic unsupervised learning， but humongous. 

   - Very soon, the data that is available these days has become so **humongous** that the conventional techniques developed so far failed to analyze the big data and provide us the predictions.

   - Thus, came the **deep learning where the human brain is simulated** in the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) created in our binary computers.

   - The machine now learns on its own using the high computing power and huge memory resources that are available today.

   - It is now observed that Deep Learning has solved many of the previously unsolvable problems.

5. Deep Reinforcement Learning

   keep training with the deep learning

   - The technique is now further advanced by giving incentives to Deep Learning networks as awards and there finally comes Deep Reinforcement Learning.



CNN (convolutional Neural Networks) --> images

RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) --> stragitistic



Consider the following steps that define the Machine Learning process

- Identifies relevant data sets and prepares them for analysis.
- Chooses the type of algorithm to use
- Builds an analytical model based on the algorithm used.
- Trains the model on test data sets, revising it as needed.
- Runs the model to generate test scores.



Amount of Data

​	data is depend on the model, clearing data is important

Computationally Expensive

- Successful training of deep Neural Networks may **require several weeks of training time.**
  - traditional machine learning algorithms take only a few minutes/hours to train.

## Class 2 Sept21

### Ideation

### data preparation

deep learning about the quantity and quality

### Prototyping and testing

Build a model or set of models

### Prodectization

high performing, scaleable



Require MLOps (machine learning operations)



CNN (convolutional Neural Networks) --> feature and construction

- computer vision
- complex ++ layer ++ 
- The construction of a convolutional neural network is a multi-layered feed-forward neural network

RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) --> stragitistic



Level Machine learning: understand math, modeling, Tuning (就想是DJ在调节音乐based on people 状态)， Application



1 pixel  == 1color  == 4 bytes(A R G B)

**A R G B** 

Alpha is represent the transparency

如果有一个照片，大小是1000x100 pixel

byte  = 1000 x 1000 x4 = 4000000 

kb = byte/1024 = 3906

MB = 3906/1024 = 3.8



通过每一个图片代表的数字去对比图片

会有一个3x3或者是4x4的小框框在图片上loop，然后calculate所有的数字，储存下来对比
