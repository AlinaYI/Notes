## Guess page

Welcome to our Guess Game - a test of your guessing and word skills. In this simple yet captivating game, your objective is to guess a secret 5-letter word. Here's how it works:

- Enter any 5-letter word into the input field and press the guess button.
- If your guess is not a valid 5-letter word, you'll receive a message saying, "XXX was not a valid word", where XXX is your guess.
- If your guess is valid but not the secret word, we'll tell you how many letters your guess has in common with the secret word. For example, "XXX had N letters in common".
- And if you guess the secret word, which is "RECAT" (a playful mix of 'cat' and 'React'), you'll see the message "XXX is the secret word!"
